# Limonene Data Description

## Descriptions
From Chyi-Shin:
3 strains: Different induce Optical Density(OD), inducer level(IPTG)
2X    H(2.5)    h(500um)
A     M(1.2)    m(100um)
B     L(0.2)    l(25um)

e.g. 2X-Hm Strain 2X was induced at High OD(2.5), and [IPTG] was at medium level(100um)

BL strains are strains built after PCA analysis of the 27 data to verify if the analysis identified the right factor which can improve limonene production

*unit: mg/L, except OD(absorbance)
*measurement were at 24hr time point
